wheeled-base
============

Goal: design a robust, affordable, adaptable wheeled base for future projects.

## Communicate Channels

* Google Group: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/robomakery-wheeled-base
* Trello Board: https://trello.com/b/tdWniHWv/wheeled-base-development

## Design Requirements

### Less than $100 USD for BOM parts

The actual cost to purchase all the parts necessary to build the wheeled base should be $100 USD or less.

[See the existing BOM](hardware/BOM.md) for existing costs.

### 3d printed and stock parts

First preference for parts should be 3d printed.  Otherwise should be commodity hardware that is easily sourced.

### ROS integration

First-class ROS integration

### Parameterized

Easily create base anywhere from 6-inch to 24-inch diameter
